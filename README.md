## ðŸ“° News Application

- *An application to read and search for news and manage todo tasks.*<br>
- *The data about news will be fetched from the News API - an API that helps retrieve data about articles based on different categories.*<br>
- *Additionally, you will also develop a Login/Register feature for the website to manage users.*

I know it's not perfect, and there is room for improvement in the future.
But I feel so happy and proud of myself after completing my little App. Practice makes perfect ðŸ˜¤!

> [!NOTE]
> Since 22 May 2020, News API changed the liberties of the free developer keys and now they reject any request using that key that is not coming from localhost. You need to buy one of the keys intended for projects on production. But as long as the page is in localhost the free version still works.
